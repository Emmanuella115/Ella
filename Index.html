<p> <b>Peter Gregory Obi CON </b> (Igbo: [òbí]  born 19 July 1961) is a Nigerian politician and businessman who was the Governor of Anambra State from <b> 17 March 2006 </b> until his impeachment on 3 November 2006; he was reinstated on 9 February 2007 and continued his tenure until 2010. <br> 
He was re-elected in for a second term which ended on 7 March 2014. A member of Labour Party since 2022, he was the presidential candidate in the 2023 Nigerian presidential election.
Born in Onitsha, Anambra State, Obi graduated from Christ the King College, Onitsha for his secondary education and University of Nigeria, Nsukka, for his tertiary education. <br> 
<i> He began his career in banking and later went into politics when he contested for Anambra State Governor in 2003 under the All Progressives Grand Alliance. </i>
 Chris Ngige was declared the winner but was annulled following a legal ruling challenging the outcome. 
 Obi was later declared the winner and elected candidate, hence becoming the governor on 17 March 2006.
Obi's administration was however interrupted shortly after as he was removed from office by the state assembly 3 November, 2006. The state assembly cited "gross misconduct" on the part of Obi for its action. <br>
 Obi headed once more to court, as the position of Governor devolved to his deputy, Dame Virginia Etiaba. 
 He was restored to office and resumed as governor 9 February, 2007. 
 Obi was yet to complete his tenure when another election was held to fill the position: the electoral body, INEC, was more interested in keeping to its schedule of elections than consideration of fairness to Obi. <br>
 This "election" produced Andy Uba of the People's Democratic Party (PDP) as Governor. His swearing in on 29 May, 2007 meant forcible removal of Obi from the governorship seat. Obi was yet once more compelled to seek judicial help. <br>
The Supreme Court upheld Obi's position, overturning another illegality to enable Obi serve out his governorship from 14 June, 2007 to 17 March, 2010. 
 Obi successfully ran for re-election and subsequently held the governorship till 17 March,
 2014 when he handed over to his successor, Willie Obiano.</p>
