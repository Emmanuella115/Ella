<h1>The consumer goods sector also contributed significantly to the rally, with companies like Guinness and University Press recording notable price
     gains of 9.98 per cent and 10 per cent, respectively. These gains are attributed to strong fundamentals, improved earnings reports, 
     and positive market sentiment around consumer demand.</h1>
<p>The Nigerian Stock Exchange recorded a market value gain of N479bn at the close of trading on Thursday, August 7, 2025. This impressive growth was driven largely by strong performances in the insurance and consumer goods sectors, which attracted increased investor interest and boosted overall market confidence.
At the end of the trading session, a total of 1.98 billion shares were exchanged in 35,282 deals, representing a 16 per cent increase in trading volume compared with the previous day. However, turnover declined by 10 per cent to N27 bn, reflecting a shift in the value of traded stocks amid a more active market.
The benchmark All-Share Index gained 756.83 points, equivalent to a 0.52 per cent increase, closing at 146,570.69. This rise extended the market’s weekly gain to 4.8 per cent and its year-to-date gain to an impressive 42.4 per cent.
 Other key indices also posted gains, with the NGX Insurance Index surging 8.76 per cent and the NGX Consumer Goods Index rising by 4.08 per cent.
